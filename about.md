Hi, i'm victoria! You might recognize me from the Rust community, where i helped maintain the
`rustdoc` tool, and the `docs.rs` documentation hosting service.  I've also written some other Rust
libraries, and even written some not-Rust things for dayjobs and other personal projects. Thanks for
stopping by!

Some projects that i've worked on include:

- [egg-mode][], a Twitter library for Rust
- Documentation tooling in the Rust project, including [rustdoc][] and [docs.rs][]
- An increasing body of [Vim configuration][], including a handful of personal plugins linked from
  that repository description
- [youarevalid.fyi][], a small site reminding people that their struggles are valid
- [mkcolor][], a Vim color scheme randomizer
- [FOSS Pride][], a handful of free-software logos modified to include LGBTQ+ pride flags
- [various other libraries, sketches, and personal tools][repo-list]

In a past life, I hung out in chiptune communities and wrote some covers as [icesoldier][].
If you knew me before 2015 that's the alias I would have used.
